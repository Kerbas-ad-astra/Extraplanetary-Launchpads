refurbish
	Solid Fuel
	Ablator
	Parachutes
	... (resources with resource recipes)

rebalance converters
	use LFO (+EC?) to power smelter
		assuming LF is RP-1, the mix seems to be pretty good for supplying
		the needed carbon and about half the heat energy.
	use resource recipes (converter recipes?)

disposable pad DONE
	works like a normal pad except:
		it is destroyed when the build is finalized
		the build is permanently attached to the previous location of the pad
			use root part
				require stack node
					use top node
				use "roll" of pad part to determine roll of build's root part

recycler
	pause instead of dump
	capture but don't recycle (+release?)
	reduce randomness with upgrades

structural material
refractory material
transparent material
